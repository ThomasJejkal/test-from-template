## How to build

In order to build this microservice you'll need:

* Java SE Development Kit 8 or higher

After obtaining the sources change to the folder where the sources are located perform the following steps:

```
user@localhost:/home/user/template$ ./gradlew -Pclean-release build
> Configure project :
Using release profile
<-------------> 0% EXECUTING [0s]
[...]
user@localhost:/home/user/template$
```

The Gradle wrapper will now take care of downloading the configured version of Gradle, checking out all required libraries, build these
libraries and finally build the base-repo microservice itself. As a result, a fat jar containing the entire service is created at 'build/jars/base-repo.jar'.
